-Pass 1 of the XE is largely complete though it will benefit from more error checking for too many/not enough arguments

Significant progress in the XE assembler has been made.
I understand how the XE object code is to be generated, the implementation will follow soon.
Currently everything is still printed to console for easier debugging.
