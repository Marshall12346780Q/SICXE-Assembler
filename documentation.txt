-Pass 1 of the XE is largely complete though it will benefit from more error checking for too many/not enough arguments
-Pass 2 formats 1 and 2 are complete (with debugging jargon)
-Pass 4 is started

Indirect Addressing..
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how I might actually go about retreiving the word
stored at the specified memory address for the purposes of index addressing.. wouldn't I practically
need to build a VM to access memory like that? 
Then I realized that it's not the assembler's concern how the TA is used, what is done with the TA, it just needs to 
find what the TA is and spit it out. That makes things much easier and explains why the example I studied in the object
file format document didnt seem to care about the value stored in the TA; it just needs to calculate the TA.
