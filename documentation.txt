Finished format 3 logic. Every format-case is now handled, though 
the output needs to be formatted. M records need to be printed, but should
be much easier as they only include format 4 instructions. Also needs to switch
from print-to-console to print to file. Errors and exceptions should be checked 
with a code review and then tested.
