Documentation for the SIC XE Assembler, Project 4
Due Dec 4
Group: Marshall Lang

-Removed profanities and anger in comments, development relics from project2 due night
	-a disproportionate waste of time resulted from not understanding dynamic memory allocation and strtok properly. Attempting to 
	'just make the program work' without due diligence in understanding concepts (which really weren't that difficult here)
	is actually much harder. Issues were very preventable but I'm PMA. It was a lEaRnInG eXpErIeNcE
-Added E Record


This push mainly serves to store a version prior to upcoming improvements to line counting and handling of the H record that will 
also fix M records to include the first line and omit last as it should.
