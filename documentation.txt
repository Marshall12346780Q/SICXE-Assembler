Documentation for the SIC XE Assembler, Project 4
Due Dec 4
Group: Marshall Lang

-Every line is now counted, for proper error reporting
-A couple redundant variables previously used for record printing are removed 


This appears to be a working non-XE assembler that prints to console. 
Next, I will make the small changes to print to file and test with the p2 test files,
though this specifically is not of great importance as the goal is to build an XE assembler, 
some relevant bugs may be revealed.
 
Then, a code review +implementation planning in preparation for XETREMEing it.

NOTE: this and previous pushes contain a 'test21.sic.obj' file that is not generated by my
program, but by the 'sicasm' command on the UNF server. It's not my work or intellectual 
property and all that.
