Documentation for the SIC XE Assembler, Project 4
Due Presentation Day
Group: Marshall Lang

Cleaned up format 4 code, made progress into format 3 and planned its completion;
the logic is diagrammed for the cases properly.
Next I'll take care of the M records (only needed for format 4's?) and make sure the
program can assemble SIC (the file extension can be used to determine the output)
Then clean up some more code and make sure errors are covered.I mainly just wanted to
commit before starting the drive home.
